## Subgraphs data

This folder contains all subgraphs files generated from each user.
All subgraphs created using a 2 stage MapReduce procedure, that runs in a parallel scalable process.
Each row composed of a certain user, and all its user edges. The final output is a row for each user, composed of all its hop-2 edges,
i.e. its neighbors of neighbors.
